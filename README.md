# CaryAgos Bank Engineer Recruitment Test

Thank you for opting to take our Engineering technical test. The tests consists of two parts:

## Coding Test
CaryAgos Bank has a snapshot database which holds point of sale transaction records of its customers for the year **2017** and **2018**. Each transaction record contains the following details

* User identifier
* Transaction date

A separate table exists which links the transaction location Id where a transaction occurred to the most applicable category Id. There are currently 6 defined categories in the system

* 1010 – Restaurant
* 1020 – Groceries
* 1030 – Shopping
* 1040 – Transport
